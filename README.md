This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Dart that occurs when the null-aware operator (!) is used incorrectly. The `bug.dart` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides the corrected code. This error happens when attempting to access a potentially null variable without proper null checks.  The solution emphasizes safe null handling techniques in Dart.
